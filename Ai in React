          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
            that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses various
            techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer
            vision, and more. AI aims to enable computers to perform tasks that normally
            require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making,
            understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns.
